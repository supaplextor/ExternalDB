Two main sections of code to consider, but first:

* This is a "skeleton" PoC app.
* I'm unable to maintain the software. I'm quite out of touch with Java, and Android Studio and I are not friends. Android development for that matter alltogether.

# JAVA Code JBDC driven

* Some wiseguy said "it can't be done" - and here we are.
* See https://github.com/supaplextor/ExternalDB/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/externaldb

# dependencies 

Look closely for mysql, mssql, postgresql here.
